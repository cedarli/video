Hi - welcome to mpeg4ip.

If you're trying to build, you can't just run the ./configure 
script.

Instead, run the ./bootstrap script.

The reason for this that mpeg4ip requires that certain other
tools are installed before beginning, such as SDL or lame or faac 
if you are using mp4live.

Then come on over to the README, COPYING, NEWS and the rest of the 
documentation in the doc directory, including:

   doc/MPEG4IP_Guide.pdf - everwicked's guide to mpeg4ip
   doc/ietf     - IETF standards and proposed standards we are using.
   doc/mcast    - using mpeg4ip to multicast
   doc/mp4v2    - manual pages for mp4v2 library
   doc/*.htm*   - html documentation of READMEs, etc

If you have questions, please try the SourceForge forums - please
do not email us directly.
