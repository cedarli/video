Troubleshooting Guide to MPEG4IP

Installation

1)The README file when the file is uncompressed says the following:
To build:
    ./bootstrap
    make
    make install (optional, typically need root privileges)

However, the documentation on the web says the following:
To build:
./bootstrap make
make install (optional, typically need root privileges)

This discrepancy is a little confusing for the user. Following the version
declared in the README file seems to work. 

3) When trying to play a file for the first time, gmp4player gave an unknown
codec error. In order to fix this, the  "make install" was required, and 
therefore, not optional.  

4) The gmp4player is installed in /usr/local/bin/gmp4player. This should be 
more clearly stated in the README.


Execution

1) After adding /usr/local/bin/ to your PATH, you can run gmp4player
with an executable or a URL that begins with rtsp:// as a command line 
arguments.

2) For no apparent reason, the player sometimes quits unexpectedly when trying 
read a stream from a Darwin Streaming Server streaming an .mp4
file created by Ivast/Adobe.  I have no solution for this.

3) When trying to play a .mp4 file created by QuickTime 6 Pro from the DSS,
the applications gives the error: "Floating Exception" midway through the 
playing of the file.  I have no solution for this either.
