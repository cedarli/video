This is a flatten version of the ISO encoder.

What I did was put all the .h* files in include,
and all the *.cpp files in the src directory.

I had to edit a number of files to put the proper
include file path.

Also, had to edit sys_block.cpp and add 
#ifndef __GLOBAL_VAR_
#define __GLOBAL_VAR_
#endif
before global.hpp

and edit vtc_ztq_Utils.cpp and add:
#define GLOBALS 

before globals.hpp
