For the MPEG4IP project, this library has been extensively modified 
from its original form, Quicktime for Linux 1.2. Specifically:

* The builtin codecs have been removed.
* Code to created a hinted Quicktime file has been added.
* The library API has been modified to support the hinting.

See the README_ORIGINAL as to how to get the original version of the library.
This code should be considered a mutation of the original not an incremental 
improvement! Caveat emptor!

The new code we wrote to handle hinting is licensed under the 
Mozilla Public License 1.1. This can be distinguished by the presence of the 
MPL header at the top of the source file.

The license for the original code is described in README_ORIGINAL.
